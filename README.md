\# Cliffside Castle Conquest  

\*\*Game Design Document (Prototype Scope)\*\*



\## Core Concept

Cliffside Castle Conquest is a 1v1 lane-based strategy game where two opposing castles sit on opposite cliffs, connected by a single narrow bridge. Both sides continuously spawn troops that march onto the bridge and clash in the center. Victory is achieved by pushing through enemy forces and destroying the opposing castle.



The game focuses on timing, troop composition, momentum control, and resource pressure rather than mechanical complexity.

\## Game Mode

\- Current: Single player vs AI  

\- Target: Player vs Player (1v1)  

\- No progression between matches  

\- No unlocks, meta upgrades, or difficulty scaling  

\- Every match starts on equal footing  



---



\## Core Gameplay Loop

1\. Resources generate over time and through bridge control  

2\. Player spends resources to spawn troops  

3\. Troops march onto the bridge and fight automatically  

4\. Momentum shifts based on troop composition and positioning  

5\. One side breaks through and damages the enemy castle  

6\. Castle destruction ends the match

\## Troops and Combat

\- Troops are organized into clear archetypes:

&nbsp; - Frontline (tanks, blockers)

&nbsp; - Damage dealers (melee or ranged)

&nbsp; - Support (buffs, healing, utility)

&nbsp; - Disruptors (pushback, stun, control)

\- Intentional counters and synergies between troop types  

\- Combat includes standard status effects:

&nbsp; - Stun

&nbsp; - Pushback

&nbsp; - Slow

&nbsp; - Temporary buffs and debuffs  

\- Troops behave deterministically once spawned, no micro-control

\## Bridge and Control Zones

\- The bridge is neutral and static  

\- No traps, hazards, or environmental damage  

\- One or more control zones exist on the bridge  

\- Holding a control zone grants increased resource income  

\- Control is determined by troop presence and strength  

\- Zones create natural comeback and snowball moments

\## Castles

\- Each castle has:

&nbsp; - A health bar  

&nbsp; - A troop spawn point  

&nbsp; - A limited set of active abilities  

\- Castle abilities:

&nbsp; - Defensive or supportive only  

&nbsp; - Player-activated, never automatic  

&nbsp; - No direct damage to enemy troops  

&nbsp; - Examples:

&nbsp;   - Area heal near the castle  

&nbsp;   - Temporary adrenaline or morale boost  

&nbsp;   - Emergency defensive pulse that pushes enemies back near the gate  

\- Abilities are designed to:

&nbsp; - Prevent sudden losses  

&nbsp; - Create clutch moments  

&nbsp; - Reward good timing

\## Resource System

\- Resources are earned through:

&nbsp; - Passive generation  

&nbsp; - Holding bridge control zones  

&nbsp; - Defeating enemy troops (secondary source)  

\- Resources are spent on:

&nbsp; - Troop deployment  

&nbsp; - Castle ability usage  

\- No resource carryover between matches  



---



\## AI (Prototype Scope)

\- AI uses the same rules and mechanics as the player  

\- Simple heuristic-based behavior:

&nbsp; - Loosely reacts to player troop composition  

&nbsp; - Attempts to contest bridge control  

\- Advanced adaptation and learning are not priorities  



---



\## Visual Style

\- Stylized 2D presentation using:

&nbsp; - Simple shapes  

&nbsp; - Solid colors  

&nbsp; - Minimal animations  

\- No textures or visual noise  

\- Strong silhouettes and contrast for instant readability  

\- Depth suggested through:

&nbsp; - Layering  

&nbsp; - Parallax  

&nbsp; - Motion  

\- Camera remains stable with subtle feedback for momentum shifts

\## Feedback and Readability

\- Clear indicators for:

&nbsp; - Bridge momentum  

&nbsp; - Resource income changes  

&nbsp; - Control zone ownership  

\- Strong visual and audio feedback for:

&nbsp; - Troop deployment  

&nbsp; - Control zone capture  

&nbsp; - Castle damage  

&nbsp; - Ability usage  

\- The player should always understand why they are winning or losing

\## Narrative Framing

\- Two sibling rulers inhabit twin cliffside castles  

\- One follows harmony with nature, arcane magic, and creatures  

\- The other embraces domination, control, and modernized magic  

\- Narrative informs troop themes and visual identity  

\- Story exists as background flavor, not active storytelling  



---



\## Design Pillars

\- Readability over spectacle  

\- Strategy through composition and timing  

\- Momentum-driven combat  

\- Minimal systems, maximum clarity  

\- Every decision should matter immediately
